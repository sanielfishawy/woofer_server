1. Install pyo using ubunutu instructions on pyo web page.

2. Install jackd1.9.8. see
http://sam.aaron.name/2012/11/02/supercollider-on-pi.html

3. Modify your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH see above

4. start up jackd and alsa_out

jackd -m -p 32 -d dummy &
alsa_out -q1 2>&1 > /dev/null &

5. start your pyo app

6. use qjackctl to disconnect then reconnect the connections as they
should be pyo:output--> alsa_out:playback


7. For the record it seems like the alsa config was broken be a recent update
This might have been why my previous attempt failed.
