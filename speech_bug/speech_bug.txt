SSH ISSUE? Does mic record not work via ssh?
    - Pi ALSA record
        (arecord -Dplughw:CARD=iTalk02,DEV=0 -fS16_LE -d5 voice.wav)
        - SSH remote visual studio code - WORKS
        - SSH from mac terminal - WORKS
        - On local code terminal - WORKS
        - On local terminal - WORKS
    - Pi pyaudio record (test_pyaudio)
        - SSH remote visual studio code - WORKS
        - SSH from mac terminal - WORKS
        - On local code terminal - WORKS
        - On local terminal - WORKS
    - Mac pyaudio record using built in mic (test_pyaudio.py)
        - From code terminal - FAILS - records empty file.
        - From native teminal with built in mic - WORKS
        - From native teminal with usb mic - WORKS
    CONCLUSION:
        - Recording from a code terminal doesnt work only when recording on mac hardware. This is becuase the terminal
            has not been granted permission to use the mic.
        - Recording via ssh either using pyaudio or arecord works on pi regardles of whether done via:
            - Local code terminal
            - Local native terminal
            - Remote code terminal
            - SSH from mac native terminal.

SAMPLE RATE ISSUE?
    test with 8K sample rate.
        - Check pulse using pacmd list-sources
            - Found that iTalk mic is the default mic.

        - arecord
            - hw  - arecord -Dhw:CARD=iTalk02,DEV=0 -fS16_LE -r8000 -d5 voice.wav
                Recording WAVE 'voice.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono
                Warning: rate is not accurate (requested = 8000Hz, got = 44100Hz)
            - plughw - arecord -Dplughw:CARD=iTalk02,DEV=0 -fS16_LE -r8000 -d5 voice.wav - WORKS
            - plughw - arecord -Dpulse -fS16_LE -r8000 -d5 voice.wav - WORKS
        - test_pyaudio
            - iTalk hardware device - OSError: [Errno -9997] Invalid sample rate
            - pulse device - WORKS

            - exception_on_overflow = True
                - pulse 44100 - WORKS with no exception
                - pulse 8000 - WORKS with no exception

        - test_speech.py with pulse and 8K


MINIMAL TEST OF SPEECH_RECOGNITION
    x Create a minimal test of speech recognition on mac that works with debugger.
        x Can trap debugger in speech_recognition


Ideas:
    - Rate is causing overlow exceptions?
